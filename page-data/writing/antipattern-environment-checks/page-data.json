This pattern is often introduced when relying on some third party service that only functions in production. An example might be something like Twilio, where you only want real text messages to be sent in production, so you write some code that looks like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">if (process.env.NODE_ENV === \"production\") {\n  twilio.sendTextMessage(...);\n} else {\n  console.log(\"not sending text messages outside production\");\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The first time you encounter a dependency like this, an environment check seems totally necessary, or even natural. So you don't even think about investigating alternative solutions. And to be fair, in a small enough project with only one or two such checks, the dark side of this pattern might not rear it's ugly head. So what is the problem with writing code like this?</p>\n<h2>The Problem: Environment checks make development painful</h2>\n<p>Just because a particular dependency should only be enabled in production doesn't mean that development involving that dependency only occurs in production. Even beyond the first time you develop a feature around a check like this, you still need to come back and maintain or even just test that functionality. That means at some point, some developer is going to need to flip that feature on locally.</p>\n<p>At this point, a developer has two options -- they could flip the app to run in production mode, or they could temporarily modify only the check around the code they are trying to modify. The problem with the first approach (running in production mode locally) is that it also might turn on a lot of other things that they don't want to be turning on locally, that have nothing to do with the change they are making. For example, consider an application with environment checks around Twilio and Paypal:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">// File A:\nif (process.env.NODE_ENV === \"production\") {\n  twilio.sendTextMessage(...);\n} else {\n  console.log(\"not sending text messages outside production\");\n}\n\n// File B:\nif (process.env.NODE_ENV === \"production\") {\n  paypal.performTransaction(...);\n} else {\n  console.log(\"not performing paypal transactions outside production\");\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>At this point we might inadvertently be performing Paypal transactions when we set <code>NODE_ENV=production</code>. That's unlikely of course, since Paypal would probably require additional configuration which probably wouldn't exist on a developer's machine. But this could still cause issues. Consider what would happen if another function first called the Paypal code, and then called the Twilio code. Without the proper configuration, the Paypal transaction would likely fail, throwing some error, which would need to be worked around (probably through temporarily hardcoding Paypal to be off) in order to test the Twilio code getting called afterwards.</p>\n<p>The problem with the second approach (temporarily modifying a check) is that there easily could be multiple places in the code where a check is made for a given feature. All of those places will need to be modified and kept track of (and carefully watched so they don't get checked into version control!). This can be solved with indirection, but in my experience, lack of indirection is often comorbid with lots of environment checks.</p>\n<h2>The Solution: Implement feature-specific configuration settings</h2>\n<p>Instead of using environment checks, use feature-specific configuration settings to control whether those features are switched on and off. If you're following the <a href=\"https://12factor.net/\">twelve-factor methodology</a> (highly recommended!) then you'll be storing those settings in environment variables. Modifying the example above with both Twilio and Paypal integrations, we end up with something like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">// File A:\nif (process.env.TWILIO_ENABLED === \"true\") {\n  twilio.sendTextMessage(...);\n} else {\n  console.log(\"not sending text messages outside production\");\n}\n\n// File B:\nif (process.env.PAYPAL_ENABLED === \"true\") {\n  paypal.performTransaction(...);\n} else {\n  console.log(\"not performing paypal transactions outside production\");\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now you have full control over what features are enabled in any environment. You can easily have Twilio enabled but Paypal disabled. Depending on how much control you need, it's possible to break down these \"switch\" variables even further. For example, giving Twilio voice functionality and text messaging separate configuration settings.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"June 25, 2020","path":"/writing/antipattern-environment-checks","title":"Antipattern: Environment Checks"}}},"pageContext":{}}}
